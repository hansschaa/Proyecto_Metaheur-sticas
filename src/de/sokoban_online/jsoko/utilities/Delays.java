	/* Computation of effective delay step.
	 *
	 * For a non-positive value of the intended sequence length of delay steps
	 * we need not compute anything: we just use the nominal delay.
	 * These reduction considerations are for positive values of the
	 * intended length of the sequence.
	 *
	 * Letting the total time of the sequence increase linearly with the
	 * length of the sequence is ok for short sequences, but for longer
	 * sequences the user becomes impatient.  As an example lets assume
	 * the user has chosen a small delay time like 20 ms (speed 230).
	 * A sequence length of 100 steps (what is quite possible in larger
	 * levels), already results in a total time of 2000 ms = 2 seconds.
	 *
	 * The classical approach (until Feb-2011, version 1.61) was to reduce
	 * the single step delay by (intendedLength / 10).  On a second look
	 * that is not really that good, since now the total time depends
	 * on the intendedLength squared and negated (!).
	 *
	 * L = intendedLength
	 * D = stepMillis
	 *
	 * T = L * (D - L/10)
	 *   = L*D - L^2/10
	 *
	 * Numerically the total time drops into negative values.
	 *
	 * Ok, the question is, in what way do we reduce the total time
	 *     T = L * D
	 * such that it still is monotone in L?
	 *
	 * Let us try an approach where T(L) is O(sqrt(L)), i.e. T increases
	 * with L, not linearly as O(L^1), but rather as O(L^0.5).
	 * We derive the mathematical formula for such a computation.
	 * We search for a function
	 *
	 *  R(L) = reduced length <= L * D
	 *  R(L) ~ O(sqrt(L))
	 *
	 * For small values of L we want to be approximately linear.  Hence:
	 *
	 *  R(0)  = 0
	 *  R'(0) = 1
	 *
	 * Note: when we want to anchor this at 1 instead of 0, we just shift
	 * the argument L by one:  h(L) = 1 + R(L-1)  and fix h(0) = 0.
	 *
	 * For the inverse function L(R) the conditions are similar:
	 *  L(0)  = 0
	 *  L'(0) = 1
	 * but computation with this O(R^2) function is easier. In general:
	 *  L(R)  = a*R^2 + b*R + c
	 *  L'(R) = 2a*R  + b
	 *
	 * From L(0)  = 0 we have a*0^2 + b*0 + c = 0  <==>  c=0
	 * From L'(0) = 1 we have 2a*0 + b = 1         <==>  b=1
	 * Hence:
	 *  L(R)  = a*R^2 + R  =  R(aR + 1)
	 * leaving one free parameter "a".
	 *
	 * In order to determine the free parameter "a" we fix another point
	 * of the function R, e.g. R(10) = 9.  More generally:
	 *  R(M) = N              with 1 <= N <= M
	 * We want the sequence length M to be handled as if it were N, only.
	 *
	 * In terms of L(R) we now have:
	 *       L(N) = M
	 *  <==> a*N^2 + N = M
	 *  <==> a = (M - N) / N^2
	 * That completely fixes the function L(R), and indirectly also R(L):
	 *
	 *  a     = (M - N) / N^2
	 *  L(R)  = a*R^2 + R
	 *
	 * With u = 1 / (2a) ...
	 *
	 *  L/a = R^2 + (1/a)R
	 *  2uL + u^2 = R^2 + 2uR + u^2 = (R + u)^2
	 *  R + u = sqrt( 2uL + u^2 )
	 *
	 *  R(L) = -u + sqrt( 2uL + u^2 )
	 *
	 * With u = N^2 / (2(M-N)) we yield:
	 *
	 *            N^2           N^2*L     N^4
	 *  R(L) = - ------ + sqrt( ----- + -------- )
	 *           2(M-N)          M-N    4(M-N)^2
	 *
	 * Better use the first formula with "u".
	 *
	 * Here are some results for M=10 and N=9:
	 *   0 -->  0
	 *   1 -->   .99
	 *   2 -->  1.96
	 *   3 -->  2.91
	 *   4 -->  3.85
	 *   5 -->  4.77
	 *  10 -->  9.16
	 *  15 --> 13.24
	 *  20 --> 17.08
	 *  30 --> 24.16
	 *  50 --> 36.60
	 * 100 --> 61.80
	 * 150 --> 82.28
	 *
	 * Here are some results for M=5 and N=4:
	 *   0 -->  0
	 *   1 -->   .94
	 *   2 -->  1.80
	 *   3 -->  2.59
	 *   4 -->  3.33
	 *   5 -->  4.02
	 *  10 -->  7.03

	 *  50 --> 21.70
	 * 100 --> 33.32
	 * 150 --> 42.34
	 *
	 * I have tested / experimented with this using Haikemono level #28.
