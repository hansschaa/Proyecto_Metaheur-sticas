/**
 * This class provides support for the typical situation, that multiple
 * listeners want to register (as a listener) at some object of the
 * model domain.  Whenever the model changes, it shall notify (inform)
 * all currently registered listeners about the change, so that the
 * listening GUI objects can update their view.
 *
 * Logically, this may just be a queue or set of listeners, but we have
 * several issues with the simple approach:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>From the multiple listening GUI objects we should expect that their
 *      registering and unregistering requests occur concurrently.
 *      I.e. this class should be thread safe.
 *  <li>We want to be prepared for the case that some listening GUI object
 *      fails to properly unregister at this class.  Then, this listener set
 *      would hold the last reference which stops the garbage collector from
 *      collecting the logically already dead GUI object.
 *      Hence, here we shall use a {@link WeakReference} to remember the
 *      registered listener objects.
 * </ul>
 * As a consequence of synchronization we shall offer a way to notify all
 * the listeners either in a synchronized way, or in a decoupled way.
 *
 * Also, we want to offer a type safe but general way to connect the
 * event generator with the event listener. That causes us to use
 * the classes {@link ListenerCaller} and {@link Generator}.
 * The latter one is necessary since in general event objects are not immutable.
 *
 * In order to have the {@link WeakReference}s to work in the intended way,
 * we must not have / implement any further strong references to that same
 * GUI listener object.
 *
 * Note that we implement a set and not a list: we assume that we may inform
 * the registered listeners in no specific order.
 *
 * The main usage inside of JSoko is for {@link ActionListener}s.
 *
 * @param <L> the type of the listeners to be registered
 * @param <E> the type of the events consumed by the listeners

 * @see ListenerCaller
 * @see Generator
