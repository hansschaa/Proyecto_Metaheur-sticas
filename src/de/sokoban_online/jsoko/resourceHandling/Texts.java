	 * Error handling and normal texts ...
	 *
	 * Most kinds of diagnostics reflected to the user do use this module
	 * to retrieve a diagnostic text via some text key.  Hence, we here
	 * have to consider two special cases:
	 *
	 * (1) When we detect some error condition inside of this module,
	 *     and we want to reflect the problem to the user (tell her, what
	 *     is going on) we cannot always use the translation service
	 *     provided by this very implementation to tell about the special way
	 *     in which it does not work.
	 *
	 * (2) When the requested combination of current language and requested
	 *     text key cannot be retrieved (for whatever reason), and the text
	 *     was intended to utter an error condition, we should not just
	 *     come up with an empty diagnostic, or, even worse, we should not
	 *     stumble over a null pointer exception and crash the program.
	 *     If we would not have tried to translate all texts (including
	 *     diagnostic ones) into different languages, and would pester
	 *     everybody with fixed English diagnostics, we would be better off
	 *     in such a case, since the intended diagnostic would be there,
	 *     and the program would not crash without a meaningful comment.
	 *
	 * Case (1) is currently solved this way:
	 *     All errors detected inside this module do NOT cause the usual
	 *     diagnostic popups, but rather restrain to low level diagnostics
	 *     on System.err, and also are just fixed English text.
	 *
	 * Case (2) is more difficult to solve...
	 *
	 * Currently (2011-03-25) nothing special is done about it.
	 * It is not very probable, that a required diagnostic text is not found,
	 * but in case it does happen... the program may crash indeed.
	 *
	 * FFS/hm: to be continued
