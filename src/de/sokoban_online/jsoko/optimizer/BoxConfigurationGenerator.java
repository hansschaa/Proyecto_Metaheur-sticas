	/**
	  Description for avoiding duplicates while generating box configurations:

	  Some duplicate box configurations can be pruned already before they are generated.
	  An example with vicinity settings 10/20 and four boxes A, B, C, and D:

	  01. A:10 B:20
	  02. A:10 C:20
	  03. A:10 D:20

	  04. B:10 A:20 only A:11-20 is necessary (see 01)
	  05. B:10 C:20
	  06. B:10 D:20

	  07. C:10 A:20 only A:11-20 is necessary (see 02)
	  08. C:10 B:20 only B:11-20 is necessary (see 05)
	  09. C:10 D:20

	  10. D:10 A:20 only A:11-20 is necessary (see 03)
	  11. D:10 B:20 only B:11-20 is necessary (see 06)
	  12. D:10 C:20 only C:11-20 is necessary (see 09)

	  There is one special case where this duplicate pruning cannot be applied.
	  An example with vicinity settings 5/5 and two boxes A and B on a 6-square board:

	  A---B-

	  01. A:5 B:5
		  A moves first. Note that no box configurations are generated with
		  A at B's original square because that square is occupied at the
		  time A moves around on the board.

	  02. B:5 A:5
		  B moves first. If this leg was pruned entirely, the following
		  box configuration would not be generated:
		  ----AB
		  This type of box configuration occurs when B moves to a square which
		  A cannot reach within its limit, and A moves to B's original square.
