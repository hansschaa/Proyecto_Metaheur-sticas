 * Stores box configurations.

 * Box configurations contain the box positions as a bit array,
 * and are usually stored in byte arrays.
 * The optimizer needs the box configurations stored in an array.
 * More precisely: it needs to name the box configurations by an int index.
 * For a lower RAM usage the "visitedData" structure in the optimizer
 * is only created for really created box configurations.
 * Thus the hash table is forced to number the stored box configurations
 * because the optimizer must know which box configuration got which number.
 * [the hash table contains more elements than box configuration have
 * been created].
 * <p>
 * This storage is of "accum" type, i.e. once a box configuration is entered,
 * it is not deleted, again, until the complete storage is cleared.
