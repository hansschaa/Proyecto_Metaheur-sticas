/**
 * This code is heavily inspired by the code from Sébastien Gouëzel. It's a
 * migrated version of his C++ coding. Hence, a big "thank you" to Sébastien
 * Gouëzel, for inventing the "Vicinity search" optimization method, and
 * generously sharing information on the method and its implementation. By
 * sharing his ideas and insights on the subject, he has made a significant and
 * lasting contribution to the Sokoban game itself, transcending the
 * implementation of the algorithm in this optimizer.
 * <p>
 * This class offers the functionality of optimizing a set of existing
 * solutions.  The incantation logic is as follows:
 * <p>
 * The constructor gets passed the most basic data of the optimization job,
 * most notably the board, inside which solutions will be optimized.
 * The constructor already starts a background thread to identify (compute
 * and collect) a certain kind of deadlock configurations.
 * <p>
 * The real optimization job is started by invocation of the method
 * <code>startOptimizer</code>, which creates a new thread to do the job
 * by invocation of our <code>run</code> method.
 * <p>
 * The optimization can be stopped prematurely by invocation of the method
 * <code>stopOptimizer</code>, which sets a global flag, that is frequently
 * checked by the worker thread.
 * <p>
 * New solutions found by this class are communicated by invocation of the
 * GUI notification callback method <code>newFoundSolution</code>,
 * in the middle of its work, and by <code>optimizerEnded</code> when the
 * optimizer has completed its work.
 *

	 * Class for generating box configurations.
	 * <p>
	 * A box configuration contains the information where the boxes on the board are.<br>
	 * Every push creates another box configuration than the one before.<br>
	 * This method takes all box configurations in the solution to be optimized as basis.<br>
	 * For each of them further box configurations are generated and saved by moving some
	 * of the boxes in them.<br>
	 *
	 * Example:<br>
	 * after 5 pushes the box configuration of the solution may contain the following box positions:<br>
	 * [10, 17, 23, 42, 60]<br>
	 * This box configuration is now used to generate new ones.<br>
	 * The user may have set (in the optimizer GUI) that one box may be repositioned.<br>
	 * Hence the following box configurations may be generated:<br>
	 * - [ 5, 17, 23, 42, 60]<br>
	 * - [16, 17, 23, 42, 60]<br>
	 * - [23, 17, 23, 42, 60]<br>
	 * - [10, 49, 23, 42, 60]<br>
	 * - [10, 17, 23, 81, 60]<br>
	 * ...<br>
	 * It's always only one box that is moved.<br>
	 * The user can restrict the number of boxes to be moved and the positions
	 * to be used for moving boxes.

		/*
		 * How this algorithm works:
		 *
		 * Definitions:
		 *    Movement: a push or move in the solution
		 *    Index of movement: index of a movement in the solution. This is also equal to the number of moves done so far.
		 *
		 * Example solution:
		 *
		 *         |- push sequence 1 -|   |-  push sequence 2  -|   |-rest of original solution-|
		 * a...b...c...d...a...d...e...f...b...c...d...g....h....i...j...k...l...m...n...o...p...q
		 * 								   X
		 * ... = arbitrary number of moves
		 * letters = pushes of a specific box
		 *
		 * The algorithm loops through the whole solution. For every push the
		 * following is done:
		 *
		 * Example:
		 * We are have just done the first push of box "c".
		 * The box is compared with the previous pushed box which is
		 * "b" -> box change. Now the algorithm treats "b" as
		 * "current relevant box". It searches for the next push of "b". The
		 * pushes from "c" to "f" shown as "push sequence 1" are
		 * "between pushes". To optimize the box changes this algorithm tries to
		 * bring forward push sequence 2 right before push sequence 1.
		 *
		 * This is done the following:
		 * 1. Mark every square in push sequence 1 that is visited by a box or the player.
		 * 2. Up from the next push of "b" (marked with a "X") all pushes are checked for not interfering
		 *    with the marked squares from 1. In the example the pushes included in
		 *    the push sequence 2 don't interfere with the marked squares.
		 * 3. Check if it is possible to bring forward pushes from push sequence 2.
		 *    If this is possible and the number of moves is <= the number of
		 *    moves in the original solution an improvement has been found.
		 *
		 * The new solution may look like this:
		 *         |-brought forward-|   |- push sequence 1 -|            |-rest of original solution-|
		 * a...b...b.....c.....d.....g...c...d...a...d...e...f...h....i...j...k...l...m...n...o...p...q
		 *
		 * The pushes "b", "c", "d" and "g" could be brought forward without
		 * increasing the number of moves. The pushes "h" and "i" couldn't be
		 * brought forward without increasing the number of moves and therefore
		 * they stay where they are.
		 *
		 *
		 *
		 * Some variables that are used in the algorithm described using the
		 * example:
		 *
		 *         |- push sequence 1 -|   |-  push sequence 2  -|   |-rest of original solution-|
		 * a...b...c...d...a...d...e...f...b...c...d...g....h....i...j...k...l...m...n...o...p...q
		 *
		 * currentBox: current box in the example would be "b".
		 * currentBoxPosition: the position of "b" after the first push of "b"
		 * currentMovementNo: in the example it would be the first push of "c"
		 * (there we detect that a box change has occurred).
		 * indexLastBetweenPushOfAnotherBox: this would be the index of the push
		 * of box "f". ("f" is the last box that is pushed before the relevant
		 * box "b" is pushed again). indexNextPushOfCurrentBox: this would be
		 * the index of the second push of box "b".
		 *
		 * "index" = movementNo = index in the solution
		 *
		 * Important: "b" is the relevant box although the current movementNo
		 * (and therefore the currently pushed box) is "c"! It's first when "c"
		 * is pushed that the algorithm detects that a box change has occurred
		 * and therefore the last / previous push (the push of "b") is taken as
		 * the relevant push.
