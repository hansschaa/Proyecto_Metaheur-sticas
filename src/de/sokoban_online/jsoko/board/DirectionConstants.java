/**
 * Here we define numeric constants for the directions,
 * that make up the geometry of a de.sokoban_online.jsoko board.
 * These constants shall be used consistently throughout the program.
 * Any class (or interface) can import these definitions
 * by an {@code implements} clause.
 * <p>
 * Direction values are coded compactly {@code 0 <= dir < DIRS},
 * and can be used as array index.
 * All direction values together with {@code #NO_DIR} fit into a {@code byte}.
 * <p>
 * The currently implemented direction model is "UDLR":<pre>
 *    U            0
 *    |            |
 * L -+- R  ==  2 -+- 3
 *    |            |
 *    D            1</pre>
 * <p>
 * The numeric values must not be changed.
 * They are used implicitly, sometimes, e.g. as index into arrays.
