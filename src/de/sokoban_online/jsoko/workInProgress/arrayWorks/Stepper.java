/**
 * This is similar to an {@link Iterator}, but is meant for array like maps,
 * with a fixed key type {@code long}.
 * Especially for sparse arrays the main work would be duplicated
 * in the calls of {@code hasNext()} and {@code next()}.
 * That inefficiency is avoided here by contracting both
 * into the {@link #next()}, which returns {@code false} at the end
 * of the iteration instead of throwing an exception.
 * <p>
 * The typical (intended) usage looks like this:<pre>
 *   Stepper<V> s = ...;
 *   while (s.next()) {
 *       long index = s.curKey();
 *       V    value = s.curVal();
 *       ... body with index and value ...
 *   }</pre>
 * The order of they keys in which the entries are delivered is not specified
 * by this interface, but rather by the constructing class/method.
